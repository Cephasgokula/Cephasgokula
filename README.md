## 🚀 About Me

I’m a software developer focused on building scalable and production-ready applications.

Currently working as a Software Developer Intern at TripFactory, where I design responsive UI components, integrate RESTful APIs, implement robust state management using Redux Toolkit, and collaborate closely with backend teams to improve performance and reliability.

I enjoy designing clean backend architectures using Node.js and Express, building full-stack applications with React, and developing AI-powered systems using NLP and deep learning models like BERT, BiLSTM, and BiGRU.

I’m particularly interested in contributing to:

- Backend systems and API design
- Frontend performance and scalable UI architecture
- AI/ML and NLP-based applications
- Open-source engineering projects

I focus on writing maintainable code, optimizing performance, and continuously improving system design skills.
